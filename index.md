title: Vote for Lyle Arcinas for CSSA President
---

Hello everybody! My name is Lyle Arcinas and I'm currently running for **CSSA President**! I've been on the CSSA council since April 2022, having previously served as Lounge Affairs executive and Director of Internal Affairs. I'm currently in my fourth year of the CS program. 
## Why do I want to be president?
I've been on the CSSA council for the better part of two years. Our CS community has grown so much since 2022, and the CSSA has grown as well. I am proud to say that the CSSA has accomplished most of the goals I had when I first ran. However, **there's still work to be done!** We have a great foundation to make the 2024-2025 school year truly great for everyone in the program. As president, my main focus will be on **student experience**. In particular, I want to accomplish three main goals for this year:

1. **Increase communication** between students and the department of computer science
2. **Foster a closer relationship to industry** and introduce more students to potential employers
3. **Promote community** and greater integration with other student groups
## Connect Faculty and Students
My greatest priority is to **open lines of communication between the department and the students**. Our program has changed a lot, and it can be very tough to navigate at the best of times. I plan to work with the incoming Director of Student Affairs to open more direct lines of dialogue between students and faculty, as well as push for more transparency about proposed changes. As president, I will **meet regularly with the department** to voice student concerns. 


## Foster industry connections
While large-scale events like the CTF are great ways for students to meet potential employers, the CSSA can do much more with its connections to industry. I will organize **smaller, employer-focused events** on a regular basis as an opportunity for industry to share their expertise with the wider community. 
## Greater Transparency 
As your student representatives, the CSSA is accountable to *you*! That's why I will implement **monthly transparency reports** about our plans and what we accomplished in the past month. I will also create **public versions of our regular meeting minutes** so that you all stay informed about what the CSSA is doing!
## Revamp the lounge
The CSSA lounge is one of our community's central hubs and an integral part of the UManitoba CS experience. However, the lounge is starting to show its age. It is clear that it will need to change to better suit our growing community. As president, I will work with the Director of Lounge Affairs to request **renovations and new furniture** to keep the lounge clean and well-maintained. If possible, I will also push for relocating the lounge to a more convenient and spacious location. I plan to **draft new guidelines** to ensure that the lounge remains a safe and inviting space for all members of our community.
## Community outreach and connections
It has not been a long time since the CSSA joined UMSU, and in that time we have worked closely with .devClub and WICS to bring you great events. I will work to further **integrate the CSSA** into the University of Manitoba student group space, as well as further our connections with any new or existing CS-related student groups.
